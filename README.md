This is a copy of the private AdriaClim and CASCADE repositories I worked for almost three years at.
AdriaClim (https://programming14-20.italy-croatia.eu/web/adriaclim/about-the-project) and 
CASCADE (https://programming14-20.italy-croatia.eu/web/cascade) were two Interreg Italy-Croatia European 
Projects in Climat Physics (in particular in oceanographic field).

Almost all code in these repositories has been developed by me. They contains scripts in: 
bash, Python, R, html, NCL and GMT languages. And other secondary tools.

After the projects ended I copied the repositories to show part of the work I figured out.

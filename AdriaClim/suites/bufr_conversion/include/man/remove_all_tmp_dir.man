This is the last task of the "buoy_bufr_conversion"
family of the "bufr_conversion" suite.
The only aim of this tast is to remove the 
temporary working directory used for the suite 
process. The path of this directory is defined in
the "buoy_bufr_conversion.ini" initialization file
as tmp_dir_root.

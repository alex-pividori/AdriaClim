#====       remove_all_tmp_dir MANUAL       ====
#===============================================

This is the last task of the bufr_conversion suite.
The only aim of this tast is to remove the working_directory
used for the suite process. The path of this dir is
memorized in general.ini as tmp_dir_root.

The task code has been copied from a previous version 
of others similar suites. Take a look at "/analysis" 
suite.
